description: This comprehensive recipe collection of over 650 pages with 1,000 recipes
  contains dishes ranging from American fried chicken and southern veal stew to continental
  favorites like Italian pork and West Indian fried bananas. Every recipe was tested
  by the author, and all were original to the book, a new standard in American cookbook
  publishing. Leslie was a marvelous food writer whose strongly stated opinions about
  cooking techniques and ingredients provided sensible advice to American cooks who
  had long suffered from the poor directions in continental cookbooks and from the
  differences in European kitchens and utensils. Her publisher proclaimed this &ldquo;the
  most complete Cook Book in the world.&rdquo; This edition of Miss Leslie&rsquo;s
  New Cookery Book was reproduced by permission from the volume in the collection
  of the American Antiquarian Society, Worcester, Massachusetts. Founded in 1812 by
  Isaiah Thomas, a Revolutionary War patriot and successful printer and publisher,
  the Society is a research library documenting the life of Americans from the colonial
  era through 1876. The Society collects, preserves, and makes available as complete
  a record as possible of the printed materials from the early American experience.
  The cookbook collection includes approximately 1,100 volumes.
